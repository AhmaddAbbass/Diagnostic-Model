Rosacea,"Rosacea typically presents with various symptoms, often affecting the facial skin. Common signs include persistent redness, primarily in the central face, often resembling a sunburn or blush. Small blood vessels may become visible, along with red, swollen bumpsresembling acnethat can be sensitive or painful. Additionally, individuals with rosacea may experience dry, irritated, or watery eyes, along with a thickening of the skin, particularly on the nose, leading to a condition known as rhinophyma. Flare-ups may be triggered by certain foods, beverages, stress, or environmental factors. Seeking dermatological advice is crucial for diagnosis and tailored management due to the condition's variability and potential long-term effects."
