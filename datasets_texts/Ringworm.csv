Ringworm (Tinea Corporis),"Ringworm, also known as Tinea Corporis, presents as a fungal infection characterized by several distinct symptoms. It typically appears as red, scaly patches on the skin, often with raised edges, resembling a ring. These circular or oval-shaped rashes may cause itching, discomfort, or a burning sensation. They commonly occur on the arms, legs, trunk, or face, spreading through direct contact with infected individuals or contaminated objects. In some cases, the patches can have a clear center with a red, raised border. Additionally, the affected skin might show signs of inflammation or blistering. Seeking prompt treatment helps alleviate symptoms and prevent the infection from spreading."
