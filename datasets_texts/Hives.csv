Disease name,Text
Hives (Urticaria),"Hives, also known as urticaria, typically present as raised, itchy welts on the skin, varying in size and shape. These welts are often red or pink and may appear suddenly, disappearing within hours or persisting for days. They can occur singularly or cluster together, spreading across different parts of the body. Alongside the skin rash, hives may cause a burning or stinging sensation and occasionally trigger swelling of the lips, eyelids, or throat, leading to difficulty breathing or swallowing. In some cases, hives can be accompanied by fever, fatigue, or digestive issues, although these systemic symptoms are less common."
