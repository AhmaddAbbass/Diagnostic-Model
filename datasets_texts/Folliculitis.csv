Folliculitis,"Folliculitis manifests as small red or white-headed pimples around hair follicles. Commonly appearing on the scalp, face, chest, back, or groin, it may cause itching, tenderness, or a sensation of burning. The affected area might exhibit pus-filled blisters or crust over, and in severe cases, lead to hair loss. Folliculitis symptoms vary, ranging from mild discomfort to painful eruptions that can cause scarring. Often caused by bacterial or fungal infections, this condition can also stem from friction due to tight clothing or skin irritation from substances like oils or makeup. Seeking medical advice helps in identifying the cause and choosing appropriate treatments."
