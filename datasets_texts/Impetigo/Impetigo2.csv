Impetigo,"Impetigo, a highly contagious bacterial skin infection, typically presents with distinctive symptoms. This condition commonly appears as red sores or blisters, often around the mouth and nose, but can occur on other parts of the body. These sores quickly rupture, forming honey-colored crusts. Itching, discomfort, and swollen lymph nodes may accompany the skin lesions. Impetigo can spread through direct contact, and in severe cases, fever or swollen glands might develop. Prompt medical attention is crucial to prevent the infection from spreading and to facilitate faster healing while minimizing the risk of complications"
