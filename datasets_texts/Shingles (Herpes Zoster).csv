Shingles (Herpes Zoster),"Shingles, caused by the varicella-zoster virus (the same virus that causes chickenpox), typically starts with a tingling, burning, or stabbing pain in a specific area on one side of the body. This often precedes the appearance of a red rash, which develops into fluid-filled blisters. The rash follows a dermatomal pattern, resembling a band or strip along the nerves. Other symptoms include itching, sensitivity to touch, and sometimes fever, headache, or fatigue. Pain can range from mild to intense and may persist even after the rash disappears. Prompt medical attention is crucial to manage symptoms and reduce the risk of complications."
