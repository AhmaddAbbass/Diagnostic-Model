Athlete's Foot (Tinea Pedis),"Athlete's Foot, medically termed Tinea Pedis, presents with several distinct symptoms. It typically begins with itching and burning sensations, often between the toes. As it progresses, the skin becomes increasingly red, scaly, and may peel or crack, leading to soreness and discomfort. In some cases, blisters may form, oozing fluid and contributing to the overall discomfort. The affected area often exhibits a foul odor, and if left untreated, the infection can spread to other parts of the foot. Athlete's Foot symptoms vary in intensity, but prompt treatment, proper hygiene, and antifungal medications can effectively alleviate the condition."
