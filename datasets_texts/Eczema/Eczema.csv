Eczema,"Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, presents various symptoms that affect the skin's appearance and texture. Common manifestations include red or inflamed patches, often accompanied by intense itching, which can lead to scratching and subsequent skin thickening. These areas may weep, crust, or scale over time. Eczema often causes dry, sensitive skin that may become discolored or develop small, raised bumps. In severe cases, it can lead to painful cracks or fissures. Additionally, eczema might provoke sleep disturbances due to itching, impacting daily life and potentially causing emotional distress due to its persistent nature. Early diagnosis and proper management help alleviate symptoms and prevent flare-ups."
