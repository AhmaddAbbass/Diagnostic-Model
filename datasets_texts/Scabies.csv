Scabies,"""Doctor, I've noticed these small, red bumps on my wrists and elbows. They itch like crazy, and I'm starting to worry about bed bugs or something. Could it be something more serious?"""
Scabies,"Scabies, a contagious skin condition caused by the Sarcoptes scabiei mite, typically presents with various symptoms. Itching, especially at night, is a hallmark, often intensifying over time. The infestation leads to burrow tracks, tiny blisters, or red bumps in skin folds and between fingers, resembling a rash. Common sites of infestation include the wrists, elbows, armpits, and groin. Scratching the affected areas may result in secondary infections. Individuals may experience insomnia due to severe itching. Prompt medical attention is necessary to diagnose scabies and avoid spreading the mites to others through close contact."
