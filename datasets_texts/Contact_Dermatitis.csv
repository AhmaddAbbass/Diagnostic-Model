These include redness, itching, and skin inflammation, often accompanied by a rash or blisters. The affected area might develop dryness, scaling, or thickening of the skin. Pain or tenderness can also be experienced. Contact dermatitis can manifest differently based on the irritant or allergen encountered, with symptoms appearing immediately or after prolonged exposure.
