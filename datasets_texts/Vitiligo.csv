Vitiligo,"Vitiligo, a skin condition affecting pigmentation, exhibits distinct symptoms, notably the development of white patches due to the loss of melanin. These patches often appear on various body parts, including the face, hands, elbows, knees, and genitalia. The condition typically progresses over time, spreading unpredictably or remaining stable. Vitiligo isn't inherently painful or contagious, but it can lead to emotional distress and social stigma due to its noticeable appearance. Besides the prominent depigmented patches, individuals with vitiligo might experience premature graying of scalp hair, eyelashes, and eyebrows, further highlighting the contrast with unaffected skin areas."
